# Changelog

All notable changes to OpenScience are recorded here. The project follows
[semantic versioning](https://semver.org). Releases are cut from `main` via the
`publish` workflow and published to npm as
[`@synsci/openscience`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@synsci/openscience); each
tagged release also ships native binaries for Linux, macOS, and Windows.

## v1.2.6 — 2026-07-06

Atlas experience polish.

### Added

- Unified `openscience status`: connection, plan, wallet balance + lifetime
  spend, recent usage, managed-compute availability, and the bundled `atlas`
  companion version — all in one view, degrading gracefully when signed out.
- Wallet settings panel and a `/settings/wallet` route surfacing the Atlas
  credits balance, billing mode, and recent transaction ledger.
- Browser Atlas login (`/account/login-key` + a first-run setup dialog) and a
  first-run flow that no longer dead-ends when no model is configured.
- Opt-in reviewer gate (`experimental.reviewGate`) that runs a blind review pass
  on a primary agent's final answer and annotates it with the verdict.

### Changed

- Bundled `@synsci/atlas` companion bumped to `^0.13.2` so managed compute
  resolves.
- arXiv retrieval hardened: per-host throttling, honest content negotiation,
  PDF-link and error-response parsing, and graceful degradation when a source
  fails.
- Model-catalog tests are deterministic (fixtured) with a nightly delisting
  tripwire.

### Fixed

- Every Atlas network call is timeout-bounded, fixing a hang where
  `project init` could run indefinitely.
- Credential sync no longer flips managed billing when a user's own exported key
  is present; synced files are written atomically.
- Codex OAuth recovers from refresh-token rotation and distinguishes a
  reconnect-required error from a transient one.

## v1.2.5 — 2026-07-05

- Seamless first-run onboarding with a clear managed vs. BYOK choice.
- Centralized catalog model pins with a delisting tripwire.
- OpenScience docs site at openscience.sh/docs.
- Spend controls in the workspace; compute keys actually applied.

## v1.2.4 — 2026-07-04

- Codex recovers from refresh-token rotation races.
- Release and npm-provenance fixes so packages publish reliably.

## v1.2.3 — 2026-07-04

- First tagged release of the `1.2.x` line.
